I'm not sure if I'll be able to finish the gravity, power-ups, pause/resume button/screen, and the environment affecting the player, but the raw ideas have been implemented. There is a pause button in the screen, but it doesn't have a function yet in this update. The code is a bit messy, but I plan to organize the code and make it more appealing tomorrow.">

     <MESSAGE value="Final Milestone 1 Update: November 10, 2023 at 7:47PM&#10;&#10;The character has been updated to flip in the direction of movement. In the next milestone, I plan to make the character more animated by adding a picture of the stickman jumping when you make it jump. I have added the background, however, this is a rough sketch of what the final environment will be. The game still doesn't have restrictions, however, I plan to add them soon. Many aspects of the game are to be determined. Overall, this final Mileston 1 product is a rough sketch of the game. I'm not sure on the title and the litte aspects of the game, however, I think I'm going to be sticking to the stickman/animated idea of the game." />
     <MESSAGE value="Update: November 15, 2023 at 7:57PM&#10;&#10;The character has been updated to have restrictions. The character can't go past the right and left border. HOWEVER, this only applies in the first floor. I have to modify the 'border restraining' function to be manipulated and only restrain a certain way for specific floors. I also intend to add gravity, however, at the time of writing this I need to figure that part out. This version of the code is function and has restrictions for the first floor. I also added a red dot for reference of coordinates on the plane. This has helped make the restrictions. There is still much work to be done :)" />
