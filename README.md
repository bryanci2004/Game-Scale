CISC108 Final Project

# Game Concept/Pitch:
  A sketch-like game that has 2 different power-ups to increase the strategy of the game, and your objective is to get the crown before the randomly spawning tape hits you!

# Final Pitch of the Final Project Game:  
  After researching potential matches that fit the final project theme("Scale") for CISC108H, I've decided to make a game like Donkey Kong. The idea is based on the retro arcade 
  version of the game while also being a stick man game! To keep things different from the original game and make things more fun, I incorporated "power-ups" that make 
  the character bigger indicating you can get hit once before you die and end the game, and another power-up that makes the character smaller making it harder for the obstacles to hit 
  you. Additionally, I implemented the  "obstacle" idea from the original retro game but not barrels, in this game it will be tape! Finally, the objective of the game unlike 
  Donkey Kong is to get the crown! This crown is placed at the top of the game where you have to avoid all the random spawning tape. Overall, the game is fun and exciting as you don't know 
  where the tape can spawn. Those who have strategy will end up victorious!

## Phase 1:
- [x] **Character Exist:** Create a player that appears on the screen
- [x] **Movable Character:** The user's character moves around using arrow keys around the screen and doesn't surpass the border
- [x] **Create Environment:** Create the environment in which the user will play, but doesn't have restrictions. Just for appearance purposes(Credits for drawing: Kaitlyn Johnson)

## Phase 2:
- [x] **The environment affects the player:** Make the environment create restrictions. The player cannot fall off, but borders are kept contained in an area.
- [x] **Create obstacles that appear for the character** What creates the game is avoiding the obstacles, so this will be implemented
- [x] **Pause/Reset Button** Not entirely sure if this will happen as writing this, or if it will be implemented. But a pause/reset button would be useful
- [x] **Create Powerups:** Powerups will appear in certain areas at random times.

## Phase 3:
- [x] **User can 'die':** If the user hits one of the obstacles, the game will restart
- [x] **Randomly spawning Tape** The user has to avoid the tape!
