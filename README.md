# Game-Scale
CISC108 Final Project

Final Pitch of the game: 
  After researching potential matches that fit the final project theme("Scale"), I've decided to make a game like Donkey Kong. But, by Donkey Kong I don't mean the recent games about
  him, I'm thinking of a like the Retro/Arcade Version of his games. However, obviously, I'm going to be making something different and not a one-to-one copy of his game while 
  keeping the general idea there. In order to keep things different form the original game and make them more fun, I plan to incorporate "power-ups" that make the character bigger indicating you can get 
  hit once before ending the game, and another power-up that makes the character smaller making it harder for certain obstacles to hit you. Additionally, I also plan to keep the "obstacle"
  idea from the original retro game but not barrels, I'm thinking of a different type of obstacle. I'm not entirely sure at the time of writing this README, but I want to add 3
  different environments that over time will increasingly increase in difficulty by making obstacles pass by the user faster and faster. I'm not sure if it's possible or have enough
  time for more than 3 levels, but for now, we're going to stick with 3. 

Task List:
- [ ] Create a Player that is moved by the user and moves up on the screen at certain parts
- [ ] After reaching the end goal of the first environment, move to the next and then the next and make it an endless loop
- [ ] A timer shows up on the screen showing the user how long they were able to live. If possible make a leaderboard.
