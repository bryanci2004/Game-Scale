# Final Pitch of the Final Project Game: 
  After researching potential matches that fit the final project theme("Scale"), I've decided to make a game like Donkey Kong. But, by Donkey Kong I don't mean the recent games about
  him, I'm thinking of the Retro/Arcade Version of this game while also being a stick man game! However, obviously, I'm going to be making something different and not a one-to-one copy of 
  the Donkey Kong game, but, keeping the general idea there. In order to keep things different from the original game and make things more fun, I plan to incorporate "power-ups" that make 
  the character bigger indicating you can get hit once before you die, ending the game, and another power-up that makes the character smaller making it harder for certain obstacles to hit 
  you. Additionally, I also plan to keep the "obstacle" idea from the original retro game but not barrels, I'm thinking of a different type of obstacle(**as of updating this README duck 
  tape is the move**). I'm not entirely sure at the time of writing this README, but I want to add 3 different environments(**It will probably end up being 2 environments**) that over time 
  will increasingly increase in difficulty by making obstacles pass by the user faster and faster. I'm not sure if it's possible or have enough time for more than 3 levels, but for now, 
  we're going to stick with 3. 

## Phase 1:
- [x] **Character Exist:** Create a player that appears on the screen
- [x] **Movable Character:** The user's character moves around using arrow keys around the screen and doesn't surpass the border
- [x] **Create Environment:** Create the environment in which the user will play, but doesn't have restrictions. Just for appearance purposes

## Phase 2:
- [ ] **The environment affects the player:** Make the environment create restrictions. The player cannot fall off, but borders are keeping contained in an area.
- [ ] **Create obstacles that appear for the character** What creates the game is avoiding the obstacles, so this will be implemented
- [ ] **Pause/Reset Button** Not entirely sure if this will happen as writing this, or if it will be implemented. But a pause/reset button would be useful
- [ ] **Create Powerups:** Powerups will appear in certain areas at random times. 
## Phase 3:
- [ ] **User can 'die':** If the user hits one of the obstacles, the game will restart
- [ ] **A timer:** The game's objective is to finish the game as fast as possible. So a visual timer will be on screen and will pause when the pause button is clicked and finish when the round ends
- [ ] **Create a difficulty dropdown:** I plan to make the game more challenging for those interested in a challenge. I want to create a drop-down that will allow the user to choose from Easy, Medium, and Hard
- [ ] **Leaderboard:** A leaderboard to display the previous players' high scores and see if you beat any of them. 
- [ ] **Surprise Difficulty:** On top of Hard, I want to create a crazy hard level, but this will happen hopefully if there is enough time.
